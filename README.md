## Description
The marketing team of Tinder is experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand what makes people interested in each other.

They decided to conduct a speed dating experiment with individuals who had to provide Tinder with a lot of information about themselves, which could ultimately reflect on their dating profile on the app.

Tinder then collected the data from this experiment.

## Goals
Understand the factors that spark mutual interest between individuals and lead them to agree on a second date

## Dataset
The dataset is called Speed+Dating+Data.csv and the documentation Speed+Dating+Data+Key.doc

Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people and indicates whether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.

## Content
The project is organized into three main parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data analysis:

1. **Initial Explorations:**
   - Overview of the dataset, including its dimensions and data types.
   - Identification of missing values and consideration of potential implications.
   - Displaying a sample of the dataset and providing basic statistics.

2. **Population Analysis:**
   - Exploration of demographic characteristics such as age and gender.
   - Analysis of participants' sectors of activity.
   - Visualization of the distribution of the matchs.

3. **Criteria Analysis:**
   - Calculation of the age difference leading to a match:
   - Investigation into the interests and preferences of participants.
   - Examination of the main criteria.
